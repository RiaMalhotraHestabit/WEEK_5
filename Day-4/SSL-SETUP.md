# DAY 4 — SSL + mkcert + HTTPS

## Objective

Enable HTTPS locally using self-signed certificates, configure NGINX for SSL termination, and verify secure access via browser.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Install mkcert

Installed mkcert and required browser trust tools.

**Screenshot:** mkcert --version

### 2. Install Local CA

Installed local certificate authority for browser trust.

**Screenshot:**

sudo apt install libnss3-tools -y

### 4. Map Local Domain

Mapped myapp.local to 127.0.0.1 in hosts file.

```bash
/etc/hosts entry
```

### 5. Configure NGINX for HTTPS

Configured NGINX to:

Serve HTTPS on port 443

Redirect HTTP → HTTPS


### 6. Start NGINX via Docker

Started NGINX container using Docker Compose.
